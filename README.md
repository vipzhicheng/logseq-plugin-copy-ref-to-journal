## Inspiration and Thanks

Part of my inspiration comes from the following plugins:

- [logseq-extract-plugin](https://github.com/sidharth-panwar/logseq-extract-plugin)
- [logseq-plugin-block-to-page](https://github.com/hyrijk/logseq-plugin-block-to-page)

## Notice

If you want to move multiple selected blocks at once, you must use the shortcut way. The icon top right corner is not recommended. Because it will lose the selected blocks state.
